\end{verbatim}

For more information read the official \href{//gohugo.io/overview/installing/}{setup guide} of Hugo.

\section*{Getting started}

After installing the Elate Theme successfully it requires a just a few more steps to get your site running.

\subsection*{The config file}

Take a look inside the \href{//github.com/saey55/hugo-elate-theme/tree/master/exampleSite}{\texttt{exampleSite}} folder of this theme. You'll find a file called \href{//github.com/saey55/hugo-elate-theme/blob/master/exampleSite/config.toml}{\texttt{config.toml}}. To use it, copy the \href{//github.com/saey55/hugo-elate-theme/blob/master/exampleSite/config.toml}{\texttt{config.toml}} in the root folder of your Hugo site. Feel free to change the strings in this theme.

\subsection*{Make the contact form working}

Since this page will be static, you can use \href{//formspree.io/}{formspree.io} as proxy to send the actual email. Each month, visitors can send you up to one thousand emails without incurring extra charges. Begin the setup by following the steps below:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Enter your email address under 'email' in the \href{//github.com/saey55/hugo-elate-theme/blob/master/exampleSite/config.toml}{\texttt{config.toml}}
\item Enable form by setting \texttt{enable} to \texttt{true} in contact settings
\item Upload the generated site to your server
\item Send a dummy email yourself to confirm your account
\item Click the confirm link in the email from \href{//formspree.io/}{formspree.io}
\item You're done. Happy mailing!
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Nearly finished}

In order to see your site in action, run Hugo's built-in local server. 

\begin{verbatim}
$ hugo server
\end{verbatim}

Now enter \href{http://localhost:1313/}{\texttt{localhost:1313}} in the address bar of your browser.
